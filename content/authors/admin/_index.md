I am a PhD student interested in biophysics, immunology, and data scientist. I enjoy making laboratory data analysis and exploration easier using R and python. In a large lab, there are unique challenges and needs. For example, we can now use R to take control of our SPR data analysis and build a model of binding kinetics without relying on software. We have a pipeline for pre-processing and analyzing large or small datasets that we generate with our unique tools and diagnostics. As our collaborations and datasets grow, I have started to implement machine learning algorithms to look for patterns and am interested in building an understanding of disease landscape using high throughput biomarker diagnostics and analytics.
