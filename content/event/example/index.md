title: A high throughput method for ensemble antibody affinity measurements for SARS-CoV-2 samples
abstract: Quantifying changes in the ensemble antibody affinity during COVID-19 disease offers a biophysical insight into a key aspect of immune response: affinity
maturation. This is important because the extent of affinity maturation has been
linked to disease outcome for SARS-CoV-2. To approach this problem, we
have developed a high throughput biosensing system able to determine antibody affinities simultaneously for eight covid-positive patient samples against
seven key coronavirus antigens, with the potential to expand testing against two
dozen more respiratory antigens. To compare against a ‘‘gold standard’’ technique, ELISA was used to obtain antibody concentrations for eight patient samples. Patient samples were diluted to seven concentrations and incubated on
Arrayed Imaging Reflectometry (AIR) based biosensors coated with an array
of coronavirus antigens. A pipeline was made in R to handle data and create
four parameter logistic models for each sample and antigen. The models
were used to calculate an equilibrium affinity measurement for each sample
against each antigen. Our results showed that there is in increase in antibody
affinity against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and Nucleoprotein for all patients, in
agreement with the trends seen in ELISA. Moving forward, our development
of a methodology for high throughput measurements of antibody affinity
against major respiratory antigens can further our understanding of the immune
response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines by quantifying this important biophysical
metric of the antibody response.
